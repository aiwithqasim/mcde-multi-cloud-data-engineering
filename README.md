## 🏁 Final Hackathon

The course finishes with a **one-day final hackathon**: an intensive, hands-on sprint where you **implement a case study** grounded in everything you have learned so far.

You will work from a realistic brief — similar to what you might see on a data engineering team — and **translate requirements into a working solution** within the day. Expect to combine skills across the stack: querying and modeling, Python automation, orchestration and quality practices, and cloud services (for example AWS or Azure patterns covered in the program), depending on what the scenario demands.

**Why it matters:** This is where individual topics **come together**. Instead of isolated exercises, you practice scoping the problem, making trade-offs, debugging under time pressure, and presenting something concrete you can talk about in interviews or portfolios.



## ❓ Why These Technologies?

The technologies in this course — Python, SQL, Snowflake, dbt, Airflow, Kafka, AWS, Azure — are **the most in-demand** in the data engineering industry today.

Each section builds on the previous one, reinforcing both theory and hands-on practice so you are **job-ready** by the end.

## 📝 Final Notes

Throughout this course you will engage in **hands-on projects, assignments, and real-world case studies** that simulate production data engineering challenges.

⚡ Get ready to embark on this exciting journey of becoming a **proficient Cloud Data Engineer!** 🚀
